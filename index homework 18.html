  <h3 class="h3">About me</h3>
  <div class="p3">I. Love. Design.<br> A self-proclaimed design “junkie” I began playing and working with software tools from a early age. You might say I have dedicated my life to the craft.<br>

    After successful completion of UX/UI bootcamp through University of Minnesota I look forward to leveraging my portfolio to gain additional freelance and junior design work.<br>
    
    
   I create beautiful experiences that work for both business and their users. I enjoy working through data and user experience to create impactful designs.
    I devote my spare time to photography, video editing and my family.
